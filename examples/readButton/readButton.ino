readButton.ino
-This code differs from readButtonVerbose.ino ONLY in that it does not output the button status every 0.5 seconds; rather, it only outputs the button status when a 
 button *press* or *release* is detected.

-I wanted a simple and universal, yet very powerful & reliable library to read a button or switch in such a way that I can
 easily implement toggled actions and momentary actions, know the true, debounced state of a button or switch at any given time, 
 and specify whether I want an action to take place when the button is *pressed* or *released.*  This library makes implementing all of
 these things easy for me, and I now use it on all of my projects that require reading a button or switch, so I wanted to share it with others.  
 Hopefully you find it useful too.

-See library .h and .cpp files for details

Description:
-This example will continually check the button, and whenever it is pressed or released, it will output its status to the Serial Monitor
--Whenever the button is pressed it will toggle LED 13 on or off

Circuit:
-Connect a button from digital pin 5 to GND
--the internal pull-up resistor is enabled on pin 5 to protect the pin from over-current

Instructions:
Upload the code, open the serial monitor, and play around pressing, releasing, and holding down the button, to see what happens!

//include the library
#include <eRCaGuy_ButtonReader.h>

//Global Constants:
//Pins:
const byte buttonPin = 5; //the number of the pushbutton pin
const byte ledPin = 13; // the number of the LED pin
//Define Button States:
const boolean BUTTON_PRESSED = LOW; //if using a pull-up resistor (ex: INPUT_PULLUP) on your button, the buttonPin will be LOW when the button is pressed; 
const boolean BUTTON_NOT_PRESSED = HIGH; //if using a pull-up resistor (ex: INPUT_PULLUP) on your button, the buttonPin will be HIGH when the button is NOT pressed

//instantiate an object of this library class; call it "button1"
//if not explicitly stated, debounceDelay defaults to 50ms, and the _BUTTON_PRESSED value in the library defaults to LOW; see .h file for details
eRCaGuy_ButtonReader button1(buttonPin); //object instantiation
//alternatively, the object instantiation could be explicit, as follows:
//eRCaGuy_ButtonReader button1(buttonPin,50,BUTTON_PRESSED); //note: the 50 here is the debounce delay in ms; increase if you get jitter on the button

void setup() 
{
  Serial.begin(115200);

  //configure pins
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);

  // set initial LED state to OFF
  toggleLED();
  
  //configure button1
  //button1.setDebounceDelay(50); //(optional); set debounceDelay to 50ms; uncomment this and increase the debounceDelay if the button_state jitters unexpectedly
  //button1.setButtonPin(buttonPin); //(optional), since this was established during the object instantiation above
  //button1.setPinStateWhenButtonPressed(HIGH); //uncomment this line if using a pull-down resistor on the button or switch instead of the internal pull-up resistor
