##Instructions  
Donate and download above. Install the library into the Arduino IDE (using Sketch --> Include Library --> Add .ZIP Library), then run the examples to see how to use the library. You may view the examples in the IDE under File --> Examples --> eRCaGuy_ButtonReader.  

##Description  
* I wanted a simple and universal, yet very powerful & reliable library to read a button or switch in such a way that I can
 easily implement toggled actions and momentary actions, know the true, debounced state of a button or switch at any given time, and specify whether I want an action to take place when the button is **pressed** or **released.**  
* This library makes implementing all of these things easy for me, and I now use it on all of my projects that require reading a button or switch, so I wanted to share it with others.  
* Hopefully you find it useful too.
