**Instructions**
Download the code by clicking "Download ZIP" to the right.  Extract the files, and install the library.  If you need help installing an Arduino library, check out Adafruit's excellent tutorial here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-all-about-arduino-libraries-install-use?view=all.
Basically, just rename the main folder to "eRCaGuy_ButtonReader," and then copy the whole thing to the Arduino "libraries" directory in your main "Sketches" folder.  Restart your Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  Now, you may view the examples in the IDE under File --> Examples --> eRCaGuy_ButtonReader.

**Description**
-I wanted a simple and universal, yet very powerful & reliable library to read a button or switch in such a way that I can
 easily implement toggled actions and momentary actions, know the true, debounced state of a button or switch at any given time, 
 and specify whether I want an action to take place when the button is *pressed* or *released.*  This library makes implementing all of
 these things easy for me, and I now use it on all of my projects that require reading a button or switch, so I wanted to share it with others.  
 Hopefully you find it useful too.
