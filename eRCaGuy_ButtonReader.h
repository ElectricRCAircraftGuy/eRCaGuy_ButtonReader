Library webpage: http://www.electricrcaircraftguy.com/2014/05/ercaguybuttonreader-library-for-arduino.html
-I wanted a simple and universal, yet very powerful & reliable library to read a button or switch in such a way that I can
 easily implement toggled actions and momentary actions, know the true, debounced state of a button or switch at any given time, 
 and specify whether I want an action to take place when the button is *pressed* or *released.*  This library makes implementing all of
 these things easy for me, and I now use it on all of my projects that require reading a button or switch, so I wanted to share it with others.  Hopefully you find it useful too.

 1) This file was created and edited in Notepad++ (http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
 2) The core of my debouncing algorithm is based on the Arduino "Debounce" example (which is a very thorough and well-written debounce
	by the way)	here:  http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce
